# javascript-lessons-of-note

This is a javascript repository for a list of javascript concepts. The concepts are introduced in a way that gets aspiring developers to mimmick the development environment for front-end without the use of a framework. The focus is to illustrate key Vanilla and ES javascript concepts.

This javascript series came from a need to piece together a Web2 learning resource for Web3 developers who started their development careers solely writing/building smart contracts but never got the time to actually dive into solidifying a decent grasp of traditional Web2 technologies like Javascript, Html and CSS.

Though in this series - CSS is not heavily prioritised herein. I will look to incorporating that into a React series (if I am not busy with work). Reactjs is the entry point for Web3 developers to build Dapps (Decentralised Applications) on the web.
